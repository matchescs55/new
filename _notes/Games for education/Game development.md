I have experience in [[Games for education/Game]] development, working with engines like [[Construct 2]], [[Godot]], and [[GDevelop]]. I have created educational and interactive [[Games for education]]/Games, incorporating storytelling, [[AI]]-generated assets, and engaging mechanics. My projects include a fantasy-themed educational [[Games for education/Game]] and a traffic management simulation. I am continuously exploring new tools and techniques to improve my [[Game]] development skills.

I am continuously researching and experimenting with new mechanics to bring these ideas to life! 🚀🎮

I have created several [[Games for education]]/Games, including _Dino Run_, which explores the effects of eating unhealthy food, and a Viking-themed [[Games for education/Game]] designed to test my [[Games for education/Game]] development skills. I have also developed a jumping [[Games for education/Game]] where players collect coins, interactive [[Games for education/Game]]s, platformers, spaceship shooters, _Angry Birds_ clones, - *Mario bros* clones, *fruit ninja clones*,  shooting [[Games for education/Game]]s, and many others. I am currently exploring ways to develop an educational [[Games for education/Game]]. Additionally, I have used [[Genially]] to create narrative-driven interactive experiences.
