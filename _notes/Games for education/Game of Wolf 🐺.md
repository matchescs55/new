Certainly! Here's the information for the party game, with the name changed to **"Wolf: The Party Game[[Games for education/Game]]"**:


### Wolf: The Party Game

**Wolf** is a fun and engaging party game that involves role-playing, bluffing, and deduction. Players take on various roles, such as members of the wolf pack, detectives, and other characters, and try to uncover the identities of the wolf pack members while the wolf pack tries to eliminate the detectives.

#### How to Play:

1. **Setup:**
    
    - Gather a group of players (ideally 6-16).
        
    - Assign roles to each player. Common roles include:
        
        - **Wolves**: These players are part of the wolf pack and work together to eliminate other players.
            
        - **Villagers**: Ordinary players with no special abilities, trying to identify and eliminate wolves.
            
        - **Detectives**: Special players who try to uncover the identities of the wolves.
            
        - **Healer**: A player who can save one person from being eliminated each round.
            
2. **Game Phases:**
    
    - **Night Phase**: All players close their eyes. The wolves wake up and silently choose a victim to eliminate. Then, the detectives wake up and point to one person to identify if they are a wolf or not. Finally, the healer wakes up and chooses one person to save.
        
    - **Day Phase**: All players open their eyes. The narrator announces who was eliminated (if not saved by the healer). The remaining players discuss and vote on who they think is a wolf. The player with the most votes is eliminated.
        
3. **Winning the Game:**
    
    - The game continues with alternating night and day phases until either all the wolves are eliminated (villagers and detectives win) or the wolves outnumber the villagers (wolves win).
        

#### Tips for Playing:

- **Bluffing**: Wolves should try to blend in and avoid suspicion by pretending to be villagers.
    
- **Deduction**: Villagers and detectives should pay close attention to other players' behavior and try to identify inconsistencies.
    
- **Communication**: Open discussions during the day phase are crucial for gathering information and making informed decisions.
