I have experience in business, having worked in sales and taught business at a university. In these classes, I have covered various business-related topics, including sustainability, corporate social responsibility (CSR), and fundamental business [[English]] topics for students. I also worked as a sales representative for a company in [[the United States]], where I gained valuable insights into managing a small business. This company was related to [[Technology]].
